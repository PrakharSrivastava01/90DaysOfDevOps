# Day 27 – GitHub Profile Makeover

## 1️⃣ Profile Audit (Before Changes)

When I visited my profile as a recruiter, I noticed:

- Profile was decent but not clearly structured
- Bio did not strongly communicate my DevOps focus
- Some repositories lacked proper descriptions
- README files were inconsistent across repos
- Not all projects had clean folder structure
- Some repos were not properly pinned

Overall impression: Active learner, but branding needed clarity and direction.

---

## 2️⃣ What I Improvedd ( After Changes)

### ✅ Created/Refined Profile README
- Added a short professional introduction
- Highlighted current focus (Cloud & DevOps)
- Listed tech stack clearly
- Added featured projects
- Added contact information

**Why:** Recruiters should understand who I am in 15 seconds.

---

### ✅ Organised Repositories
- Structured `90-days-of-devops` by day folders
- Created dedicated repos:
  - `shell-scripts`
  - `python-scripts`
  - `devops-notes`
- Added proper README.md to each repo
- Added meaningful descriptions on GitHub
- Ensured relevant `.gitignore` files

**Why:** Clean repos show professionalism and discipline.

---

### ✅ Pinned Best Projects
Pinned:
- Three-Tier AWS Web Application
- Two-Tier Dockerized App
- Terraform Infrastructure Automation
- 90 Days of DevOps
- Shell Scripts
- DevOps Notes

**Why:** First impression should reflect my strongest work.

---

### ✅ Clean Up
- Archived/removed irrelevant repositories
- Checked for exposed secrets (.env, keys, credentials)
- Renamed unclear repository names
- Ensured consistent naming (kebab-case)

## 4️⃣ Key Learnings

1. GitHub is not just code storage — it's a developer portfolio.
2. Clarity > Quantity. Clean repos look more professional.
3. Presentation and structure matter as much as technical skills.

## 5️⃣ Final Reflection

Today was not about coding — it was about identity.
I moved from “just uploading code” to building a professional developer presence.
